  title: Use Docker first, learn it later.
  description: Tell your imposter syndrome to shut up because you've got something else, something rarer. You've got productivity syndrome! With your dev environment up and running, you'll be cranking code in no time.

- icon: far fa-lightbulb
  title: Avoid reinventing the wheel, again.
  description: Hundreds of developers have already spent hours building out Docker environments for your language/framework. There's no point being the 999th dev to also spend hours creating a Docker dev environment.

- icon: fas fa-code-branch
  title: Easily create new custom packs.
  description: You can create custom packs for any language or framework you want. It's a great way to help fellow developers get their dev environments up and running quickly so they can get to building faster.

- icon: fas fa-chess
  title: Easily switch default services.
  description: Language packs always come locked and loaded with great defaults for whichever language/framework you're using. Most packs will also come with alternative services you can use that might suit you better.

  title: Local trusted SSL certificates.
  description: Testing your site with local SSL is always a pain. Ahoy handles all that painful work for you by automatically creating and trusting all the local certificates you need. Currently this feature is MacOS only.

##### A little more about Ahoy...

Ahoy is a lightweight tool for preparing Docker environments for your apps.
It's open source, it's easy to build on top of and it will save you a boat load of time!
 
Oh and guess what?... **You don't even need to know Docker to get started.**
 
Ahoy comes with sensible defaults so all you need to do is run a command (`ahoy install <language-pack>`) and
you'll get all the boilerplate files you need added for you.

This is all made possible with *language packs*. 

They simply contain the templates for creating the Docker files needed to 
run the language/framework and any related services an app like yours might need.

That's it. No super secret sauce, just a collection of templates (aka language packs) 
to save you from doing it manually. 

It's like Hello World for Docker & Docker Compose.
